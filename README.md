# Deuterium

Deuterium is a library of packages to help ease the set up of any experiment. There will be dev configurations using the latest in **jest**, **babel**, **eslint**, and **prettier**, as well as main web dev packages such as **TBD**.

# Install

You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Recommended is LTS and node > 8 was used to create Wolfbot.

After installing Node, I recommend installing [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). It is a package manager similar to npm but is faster.

Once yarn is installed, you can add the whole of deuterium using

```javascript
yarn add deuterium
```

or you can add seperate packages by, .e.g.,

```javascript
yarn add @deuterium/prettier-config
```
